<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year PhD student in Population Health Sciences (Epidemiology) at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, supervised by Dr. Yuan Ma. 


pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree in Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University (since 2023). During this period, I served as a research assistant under the guidance of Prof. Jennifer Schrack and Prof. Ciprian Crainiceanu. I‚Äôm also fortunate to collaborate with Prof. John Muschelli. Prior to this, I underwent a year of Biostatistics Master training at Renmin University of China (2022-2023) under the guidance of A. Prof. Yu Wang. My academic journey began with a B.Eng degree (2018-2022) earned at Zhejiang University, where I was under the supervision of Prof. Yu Zhang. I felt lucky to have engaged in research collaborations with Prof. Ming Chen, Prof. Baiyi Lu, and A. Prof. Li Li. I am dedicated to enhance my professional skills in the combination field of BIOS & BIOINFO & EPI and cultivate the ability of innovation.

I am intrigued by the integration of aging indicators (e.g. frailty, biological age), digital biomarkers (e.g. wearable measurement), age-related disease (e.g. Dementia, CVD), and omics (e.g. Metabonomics, Metagenomics, GWAS). Furthermore, exploring biostatistical (e.g. causal inference, functional data) and data science (e.g. transfer learning, deep learning) methods also drive my interest.

Sunan Gao is an incoming PhD student in Population Health Sciences (Epidemiology) at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He holds a B.Eng. from Zhejiang University and a Master‚Äôs in Epidemiology from Johns Hopkins University. His research integrates high-dimensional data analysis, causal inference, machine learning, and wearable device data to better understand and intervene in aging-related processes. His research experience spans high-dimensional data analysis, causal inference, machine learning, and wearable device. These experiences have shaped his passion for understanding and intervening in aging-related processes. He has co-authored over ten peer-reviewed publications and developed tools for analyzing biological age, digital signals and time series data. Outside of research, he enjoys photography, reading, traveling, and playing ball games.
